get-out
=======

This used to be a web based game,
but i removed everything and i will build an iOS game.

This is because i just can't use JavaScript for propper game development.

I _need_ Classes, with properties, methods and inheritance.  
I want typed variables and type safety, no weird "3" is the same as 3 behaviour  
and i want good performance

I think the web has a lot of potential for games, but right now it's just not good enough for me.
